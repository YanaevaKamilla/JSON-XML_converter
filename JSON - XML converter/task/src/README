This project is a JSON-XML converter that allows you to convert data between JSON and XML formats. JSON (JavaScript
Object Notation) and XML (eXtensible Markup Language) are both commonly used formats for storing and exchanging data.
JSON is often used in web development and APIs, while XML has a broader range of applications, including data storage
and document representation.
